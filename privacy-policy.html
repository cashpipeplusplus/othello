    <p>
      <strong>We do not collect or store any information.</strong>
      Your multiplayer ID is randomly generated every time you use the app.
      Video chat and remote play are completely peer-to-peer, meaning that your
      video, audio, and game data are sent directly from you to your friend and
      vice-versa.  It never passes through any systems controlled by the author.
    </p>
    <p>
      A service called <a href="https://peerjs.com">PeerJS</a> helps to
      establish the peer-to-peer connection with your friend, but does not
      handle any audio, video, or game data.  You may also wish to refer to the
      <a href="https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server/blob/master/PRIVACY.md">PeerJS privacy policy</a>.
