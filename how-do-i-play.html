    <h2>How do I play?</h2>
    <p>
      You take turns placing stones on the squares of the board.  You may only
      play stones that capture some of the other player's stones.  Any stones
      in between yours and the other player's are captured, and flip over to
      show the opposite color.  For example:
    </p>
    <div id="exampleBoard">
      <div class="square stone-container valid"></div>
      <div class="square stone-container white"></div>
      <div class="square stone-container white"></div>
      <div class="square stone-container black"></div>
      <div class="square stone-container"></div>
    </div>
    <p>
      In this example, is it black's turn.  The square on the left is a valid
      move, and is marked with a small gray dot.  The square on the right is
      not a valid move, because it doesn't border any white stones and would
      not capture anything.  If black plays on the left, both white stones
      would be captured and become black.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you cannot capture any of the other player's stones, you must pass.
      The app will determine this for you and give control back to the other
      player after showing "PASS" on your part of the score board at the top.
      For example:
    </p>
    <div class="stone-container white turn pass">
      <div class="msg-container"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
      When the board is full, the game is over.  Whichever player has the most
      stones wins.  The app will show "WIN" on the score board at the top.  For
      example:
    </p>
    <div class="stone-container black win">
      <div class="msg-container"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
      You can start the game over at any time using the "Reset Game" button at
      the bottom.
    </p>

    <h3>Playing locally</h3>
    <p>
      To play locally, you can use a touch screen, track pad, mouse or any
      other pointing device.  Players take turns clicking or tapping on the
      same device to make their moves.  This works really well with a tablet
      laying on the table between two players.
    </p>

    <h3>Playing offline</h3>
    <p>
      To play offline, just load the URL.  If you've loaded it before, it
      should be cached and available offline.  On some platforms, such as
      Android, you may also be prompted to install the app to your home screen.
    </p>

    <h3>Playing with a friend over the internet</h3>
    <p>
      To play over the internet, click or tap on the "P2P Multi-player" button
      at the bottom of the screen.  A video chat will appear to the right of or
      beneath the game board.  Click or tap on the text under "Your ID" to copy
      it to the clipboard.  Send this text to a friend.  Your friend then
      pastes your ID into the field labelled "Your friend's ID" and hits enter
      on the keyboard or tablet/phone's on-screen keyboard.  This will start
      the connection between you and your friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the game, you can see and talk to your friend while you play.
      There is a mute button which can be used to mute or unmute the connection.
      When either end is muted, neither of you can hear each other.  You can
      use the "X" button on the video to terminate the connection and go back
      to local play.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it's your turn, your color will have a halo behind it at the top of
      the scoreboard, and all valid moves will be marked for you with a gray
      dot.  Either player can use the "Reset Game" button at the bottom of the
      board at any time to start a new game.
    </p>
    <p>
      This game is meant to be social and played with friends and family.  It
      is not meant as a way to meet internet trolls, so there is no
      match-making service.  You'll have to send your randomly-generated ID to
      others using some other system, like a text message, chat, or email.
    </p>

    <h2>Browser support</h2>
    <p>
      This probably won't work on IE.  It should work on any current browser.
